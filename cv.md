3. I worked at the factory for 4 years and in parallel studied as an energy engineer but that was not what I wanted to do all my life and thought about changing my profession. I'm not bad with computers and I was attracted to programming. So, I decided to study the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science in Minsk. The university opened a wide selection of areas in programming and also gave new friends with similar interests. When I graduated, the choice was between web- and mobile technology. I decided that I want to do the development of applications for mobile devices and believe that way is very perspective.
